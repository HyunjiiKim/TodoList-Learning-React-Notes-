 # React Learning Notes

Welcome to my React learning repository! This repository contains my notes, thoughts, and code examples based on the book [*Book Title*]. As I learn more about React, I’ll be documenting the important concepts, patterns, and techniques I come across.

## 📚 What’s Inside

This repository is organized by chapters or sections of the book, with each file focusing on a specific concept. It’s a way to keep track of my progress and reinforce my understanding.

### Structure

- `chapter-1-introduction.md`: Introduction to React, the basics of components, and setting up the environment.
- `chapter-2-hooks.md`: A deep dive into React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.).
- `chapter-3-components.md`: Understanding functional components, props, and JSX.
- `chapter-4-state-management.md`: Managing state with React, context API, and Redux (if covered in the book).
- `chapter-5-advanced-topics.md`: Exploring advanced React concepts such as custom hooks, performance optimization, etc.

### Key Takeaways

- React is built around the concept of reusable UI components.
- Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are central to managing state and side effects.
- Context API is useful for managing global state across components.
